Tasks: 
    -Location Services - expo API: locations.startGeofencingAsyn
    -Create a splash screen: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/splash-screens/
    -implement push notifications - expo api
    -discord community??
    -for now code everything under black tent; later add options with picker in CreateGroup.js (reminder can't use directly since hooks not allowed in class component, create separate component file and import in, or figure out how to use without hooks)

Packages Installed:
    -react-picker
    -redux persist


Database: 
    -users: userID -> name, email, group code, availability
    -groups: groupCode -> name, members, group schedule (backend)
    -

Bugs: 
    -5/14 - persistence is not working on mobile device, having to sign-in everytime app is loaded
    -5/15 - sharing states between two unrelated components; solutions: custom hook, redux, react context
        -update: no longer need this (5/20)

UI suggestions: 
    -add simple game to start screen; ex: pong, ...


Issue log: 
    -git isn't case sensitive, i.e. changing file name in vscode will not be registered by git, must change from github repo
    
Access groupCode with redux:
    -import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
    -const groupCode = useSelector((state) => state.user.groupInfo.groupCode);

    firebase.firestore().collection("groups").doc(groupCode).collection("members").get().then((snap)) => {
        snap.forEach((doc) => {
            
        })
    }
